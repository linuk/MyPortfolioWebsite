						<h2>Jheng Lin Report: Large Coursework Option 1</h2>
						
						<hr>
						
						<h4><strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.<br>(These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.)</strong> </h4><br/>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Google Material Design<br>
								The well-known Google Material Design inspired the visual design for my website. the style utilises a flat deisgn which makes components look like several cards composed together. I really appreciate the simplicity of it and therefore I chose to use it as my main visual design pricinple. Although I didn't completely follow the pricinples, the overall aesthetic design had a great influence on my whole website.
							</li><br/>
							<li>adhamdannaway.com<br>
								 The author of this website is both a designer and a coder. My initial impression of his index page was that it is very simple. The simplicity of the index page attracted my attention and therefore I decided to combine my coding projects and photography portfolio together into a website. Out of the several examples I have seen, this website with the split sections on the main page is the most ideal format to what I wanted to achieve.
							</li><br/>
							<li>sublime-digital.com<br>
								This is another portfolio website that I referred to. The portfolio part of the website contains different kinds of projects with the option to select specific categories. This inspired me to implement the idea of project tags, where users can filter my coding projects with tags to easily find what they need. 
							</li><br/>
						</ul>
						
						<hr>
						
						<h4><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</strong></h4><br/>
						<ul>
							<li>Aria-label<br>
								I added aria-labels to every component that needs it, such as links in the navigation bar, icons in the about page and input areas in the form for the contact page. This way, the screen reader will never overlook any of the important components and will allow blind or visually impaired users easy access to my website.
							</li><br/>
							<li>Contrast control<br>
								After browsing contrastrebellion.com, I decided to slightly change the color scheme of my web page. Based on the <!-- WCAG --> of contrast, I updated the colors and set the contrast ratio to at least 4.5: 1, which reaches the AA level and improves the readability.     
							</li><br/>
							<li>Alts<br>
								I added alt attributes to all sections of my website that contains a photo. These allow users access to the information of the images, whenever they use the screen reader or if the brwoser fails to load the images.
							</li><br/>
						</ul>

						<hr>
						
						<h4><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</strong></h4><br/>
						<ul>
							
							<li>I considered the following three usabilities during my design based on a Danish web usability consultants, Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. 
							</li><br/>
							<li>Visibility of system status<br>
								All of the clickable links, buttons and images have hover effects, to inform the users that the components are clickable. Furthermore, there are no unnecessary hover effects to confuse users either. Additionally, the users will always know which page they are browsing from hightlight feature in the navigation bar.
							</li><br/>
							<li>Match between system and the real world<br>
								Apart from the index page, every other page contains only one card that users can easily browse and focus on. The navigation bar is always on the top and it also follows the conventions of modern websites (clicking the logo sends the user back to index page and links in the navigation bar are aligned to right). 
							</li><br/>
							<li>Aesthetic and minimalistic design<br>
								Reducing the design and information, I simplified the contents and organized them in different pages that users can easily navigate to find what they want to see via the navigation bar. Users will be provided with just enough information and they can read more by simply clicking on corresponding icons, images or links. 
							</li><br/>
						</ul>

						<hr>
						<h4><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that <br>(i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</strong></h4><br/>

						<ul>
							<li>React JS<br>
								The main point of this terms project was to learn front-end development, therefore I self-taught myself the latest trending techniques, which is React JS recommended by facebook. Via React JS, all of the elements in the pages are components, and I assembled and reused them everywhere on different pages. <br><br>
								I spent half a month learning the basic concepts and syntax of React through Codecademy in two free courses that took approximately 5 hours each. After that I began to read the documentation and some articles on different forums to find small projects that I can practice with. Furthermore, I cloned some of the React projects on github to learn from them, such as react-router.
							</li><br/>

							<li>npm<br>
								I had to learn how to use npm (the package manager for javascript) because of using React JS. In addition, I also studied React command line tool which is the main approach to using it. Reading official documentations was how I learnt it because it is very well organized, simple and clear. With npm, I could browse and install thousands of packages made by other geniuses, which lead me to admire and appreciate the concept of open source. <br>
							</li><br/>
							
							<li>Git, Github and Heroku<br>
								I uploaded all my projects including my website on Github as back up and started building my profile. I initially learnt Git on Codecademy, then studied how to use Github by watching tutorials uploaded by the local hack day team and played around with their website. <br>

								My portfolio is actually a web app instead of simple web pages, therefore I needed a server to host it. Heroku was my solution to this problem as it is the best option for free small projects. I learnt how to use it by reading the official manual as it is the simplest and best way to learn new things in the coding industry. Now my portfolio website is live on Heroku, and it will automatically be updated if I commit any change to the corresponding code on Github.
							</li><br/>

						<h4><strong>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</strong></h4><br/>

						<ul>
							<li>Latest Front-end Techniques<br>
								The most important part of doing a projact is to try and meet the industry standard. That is why I choose to use React JS to build the whole website instead of simlpy writing web pages. It was a challenging but worthwhile experience. I believe this experience and project will be helpful for when I apply to internships that are related to front-end development. 
							</li><br/>
							<li>Fully Functional<br>
								I have tested and retested my website to make sure that all <!-- features --> are working. All links, buttons, and the contact form serve a purpose other than adding to the aesthetics of the website. Aside from completing the main assignment, I also aimed to build a useful portfolio website for myself that I can use in the future to show employers my progress and achievements.
							</li><br/>
							<li>Visual Design<br>
								I personally prefer Apple's simple and clean design style which I used in combination with Google Material Design for my website. I am satisfied with the overall look and it effectively communicates the information I want to present.
							</li><br/>
							<li>Content Management by JSON<br>
								All of the text and image contents on the website is based on different corresponding JSON files so that I can easily manage the contents by modifying the JSON files instead of the web pages. This approach was less time-consuming for when I had to update and improve the readability of codes. Without using a Content Management System (CMS), this is the next best alternative to managing a website.
							</li><br/>
							<li>Full Responsiveness<br>
								Full responsiveness is the main trend of front-end web development. Majority of the time I spent on trying to make sure the layout, font-size and images still look good on different platforms and browsers. I tested it on iPhone, iPad and other platforms as well and found that the mobile device simulator built in chrome is not 100% accurate. Sometimes it looked good on the simulator but completely crashes on mobile. Therefore, I used a simulator built in Xcode to double check the responsiveness.
							</li><br/>
						</ul>

						<hr>
						<h4><strong>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</strong></h4><br/>

						<ul>
							<li>Loading projects/images in whilst scrolling<br>
								The contents on my project and photography page are currently at an acceptable amount that will not affect the loading speed too much. Once I update and increase more projects on it, I plan to add infinite scrolling techniques on it as it would be more effective and look better.  
							</li><br/>
							<li>Using CMS to manage the website<br>
								I am considering to add a blog page and upload notes about what I learn within the coding world, however this cannot be handled by using just JSON, therefore I will need to use a CMS. 
							</li><br/>
							<li>Enabling my own email function<br>
								Now my email form function is provided by a thrid party website, which is not my own code and has several restriction. Therefore, I want to learn how to use Node JS and update it with my own code.
							</li><br/>
