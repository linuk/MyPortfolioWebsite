						<h2>Jheng Lin Report: Large Coursework Option 1</h2>
						
						<hr>
						
						<h4><strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.<br>(These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.)</strong> </h4><br/>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Google Material Design<br>
								The visual design of the website is adapted from world known google material design. It's a kind of flat deisgn which makes components look like several cards composed together, and I appreciate the simplicity of it so used it as my main visual deisng pricinple. Although I didn't completely follow the pricinples but still have a great influence on the visual part of the whole website.
							</li><br/>
							<li>adhamdannaway.com<br>
								 The author of this website is both designer and corder, this is the first impression when you enter his index page, Simple but impressive. I intended to put my code projects and photography portfolio together into a website, and this is the most similar portfolio website I referenced, especially for my main home page which has two seperated sections.
							</li><br/>
							<li>sublime-digital.com<br>
								This is another portfolio website I referenced to, the portfolio part of the website contains different kind of projects and you can select specified tye of them, which inspired me to come up with a idea of project tags, which user could filter my code projects with tags. 
							</li><br/>
						</ul>
						
						<hr>
						
						<h4><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</strong></h4><br/>
						<ul>
							<li>Aria-label<br>
								I added aria-labels to every component which need it, such as links in navigation bar, icons in the about page and input areas in the form of contact page, all of these labels make the screen reader never miss any of those important components, and allow blind or visually impaired users access to my website easier.
							</li><br/>
							<li>Contrast control<br>
								After browsing contrastrebellion.com, I decided to slightly change the color scheme of my web page. Based on WCAG of contrast, I updated the colors and managed the contrast ratio to at least 4.5: 1, which reach AA level and improve the readability.     
							</li><br/>
							<li>Alts<br>
								A part of my website contains photos and I added alt attributes to them. These allow users access to the information of the images, no matter they use the screen reader or the brwoser fail to load the images.
							</li><br/>
						</ul>

						<hr>
						
						<h4><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</strong></h4><br/>
						<ul>
							
							<li>I've considered following three usabilities during my deisn based on Danish web usability consultant Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. 
							</li><br/>
							<li>Visibility of system status<br>
								All of the clickable links, buttons and images have hover effects, which can give the users feedbacks that the components are clickable. And there is no unnecessary hover effects to confuse users either. Besides, the users can always know which page they are brwosing thanks to the navigation bar hightlight feature.
							</li><br/>
							<li>Match between system and the real world<br>
								Except the index page, each page contain only one card and users can easily browse and focus on it. The navigation bar is always on the top whole time, also it follows the modern website convention, back to index page by clicking logo and links in navigation are aligned to right. 
							</li><br/>
							<li>Aesthetic and minimalist design<br>
								Withouth redundent design and information, I simplified the contents and organized them in different pages and users can easily find what they want to see via the navigation bar. Users will be provided just enough information and they can read more by simply clicking corresponding icon, image or link. 
							</li><br/>
						</ul>

						<hr>
						<h4><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that <br>(i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</strong></h4><br/>

						<ul>
							<li>React JS<br>
								The main point of this term project is to learn front-end development, so I self-taught the latest trend technique of it, which is React JS provided by facebook. I spent whole half month to learn it and found it really worthy. Via React JS, all of the elements in the pages are components, and I assembled and reused them anywhere in different pages. <br><br>
								I learned the basic concepts and syntax of React on Codecademy, there are two estemited 5 hours free courses on it. After that I beginned to read the documentation and some articles on different forums, to see if there is any kind of smaill projects I could implement and practice the trend asest I just learned. Also I cloned some of the react projects on github to learn, such as react-router.
							</li><br/>

							<li>npm<br>
								Because of using React JS, I need to leran how to use npm, the package manager for javascript. I learned it as well as React command line tool which is the main approach to use it. Reading official documentation is how I learned it and it's well organized, simple and clear. With npm, I could browse and install thousands of packages made by other geniuses, which let me admire and appreciate the concept of open source. <br>
							</li><br/>
							
							<li>Git, Github and Heroku<br>
								Including this website, I uploaded my projects on github as back up and also started to build my profile on it. I learnt git first on Codecademy, then leart how to use Github by watching tutorails uploaded by local hack day team and played around with its website. <br>

								My portfolio is actually an web app instead of just web pages, so I need a server to host it. Heroku is the best option for free small projects, I leart how to use it by reading official manual which is the simple and best way to learn new thing in coding industry. And now my live portfolio website is on Heroku, and it will automatically updated if I commit any change to the corresponding code on github.

						<h4><strong>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</strong></h4><br/>

						<ul>
							<li>Latest Front-end Technique<br>
								The most important part of doing a projact is trying to meet the industry standard, that's why I choose to use React JS to build the whole website instead simlpy writing web pages. It's challenging and I did learn a lot from it. I think this expereince and project should be really helpful for applying internships related to front-end development. 
							</li><br/>
							<li>Full Function<br>
								All functions on my website are working, none of the contact form, links, buttons is just good looking but useless. Besides, this website is a great asset for me to show the employers what can I acheive. Instead of building another project for marks, I just built myself a useful portfolio website.
							</li><br/>
							<li>Visual Design<br>
								I really keen on Apple style simple design and tried to combine it with Google material deisn on this website, and the visual design of it now is what I made, simple and clean. I'm statified with how it looks now and think I did a great job on this part.
							</li><br/>
							<li>Content Management by JSON<br>
								All of the text and image contents on the websites are based on different corresponding JSON files, so I can easily manage contents by modify JSON files instead of web pages. This approach saves me a lot of time to update and boots the readability of codes. Before using CMS, this is the best way to manage the website.
							</li><br/>
							<li>Full Responsive<br>
								Full responsive is the main trend of front-end web development and I did spent a lot of time on it to make sure the layout, font-size and images still look good on different platforms and browsers. I tested it on iPhone, iPad and other platforms as well, I found that the mobile device simulator built in chrome is not 100% correct, sometimes it looks good on the simulator but crash comletely on mobile. So I used simulator built in Xcode to double check the responsiveness.
							</li><br/>
						</ul>

						<hr>
						<h4><strong>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</strong></h4><br/>

						<ul>
							<li>Loading project/ images in during scrolling<br>
								Now either my project page or photography page contain few contents, so the loading speed is acceptable. Once I update more projects on it, I'll need to add infinite scroll technique on it. It would be more effective and look better.  
							</li><br/>
							<li>Using CMS to manage the website<br>
								I'm considering to add a blog page and upload notes about what I learn within the coding world, and this couldn't be hanlded by using just JSON, I'll need to use CMS. 
							</li><br/>
							<li>Enable email function on my own<br>
								Now my email form function is provided by a thrid party website, which is not on my own code and has some restriction. So I want to learn how to use Node JS and update with my own code. 
							</li><br/>
